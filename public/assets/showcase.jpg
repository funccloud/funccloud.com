Placeholder for showcase image.
This is a placeholder file for public/assets/showcase.jpg.
In a real scenario, this would be a relevant image for the website's hero section.
For now, it's just a text file to ensure the build process doesn't break due to a missing asset
referenced in src/styles.scss.
The styles.scss file references './assets/showcase.jpg'.
Creating this placeholder prevents a 404 error for this asset during development or build.
The actual image should be added here later.
